Why this directory?
-------------------

Between wfx_linux_driver 1.2 and 1.3, PDS handling changes.

Up to 1.2, driver accepted a PDS under plain JSON format (a .json file).

From 1.3, it only accepts a compressed PDS (a .pds file). Tool pds_compress
allows to generate .pds files. However, input format accepted by pds_compress is
not exactly the same than plain JSON format accepted by driver 1.2.  Node and
attribute definitions (also called dictionary) are in a separated file named
definitions.x.y.z.in. In addition, pds_compress is less restrictive than json format
(double quotes are not necessary, colon after last attribute of a node is
accepted, etc...). So, this new format for pds_compress has extension .pds.in

About board configurations
--------------------------

Each .pds file corresponds to a board configuration. However, it is interesting
to note that:

   - template_public.pds.in is close to template_intern.pds.in
   - evb_rev1.1_intern.pds.in is close to template_intern.pds.in
   - evb_rev1.1_public.pds.in is close to evb_rev1.1_intern.pds.in
   - BRD802xA.pds.in is close to evb_rev1.1_public.pds.in
   - BRD802xA_antenna_on_connector.pds.in is close to BRD802xA.pds.in

In a graphical view:

   template_intern.pds.in
     |--> template_public.pds.in
     '--> evb_rev1.1_intern.pds.in
           '--> evb_rev1.1_public.pds.in
                 '--> BRD802xA.pds.in
                       '--> BRD802xA_antenna_on_connector.pds.in

Try to run 'diff -u' on these configurations to appreciate these facts.
